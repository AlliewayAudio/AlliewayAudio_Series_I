2.0.4: Official release, introducing 3 of the 5 modules that will be in this series: KOAN, BUMPER, and CARTOON RUNNING!

2.0.4.1: Minor update to Koan front-panel to make normalled connection from encoder output to decoder input more obvious :)

2.0.5: Minor bugfixes, update to fix linux graphics. Some additional quality of life changes coming soon, and modules 4 and 5 are in the works (as well as another special surprise!)

2.0.5.2f61e33: User-requested feature added to Bumper - bump size scaling. It’s been added as a right-click menu option (underneath “Bump Polarity”), allowing you to choose between the original behavior (default) and the bump sizes being scaled based on boundaries.
